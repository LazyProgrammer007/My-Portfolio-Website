                    I'm looking to set some long term goals now. I realised I'm being sidetracked by all the different technologies coming out and I really want to settle down and focus on one thing. I believe setting a definite goal will help me achieve that. I know goals are personal and unique, but I'm sure I can get some inspiration from someone
